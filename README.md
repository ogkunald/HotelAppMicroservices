## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the HotelAppMicroservices application, you need to have the following software and tools installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) - 11 or higher.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - LTS version.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (for containerization, if used).
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (for orchestration, if used).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ogkunald/HotelAppMicroservices.git
Build and run the microservices as per their respective README files.

```

## Usage
Open your web browser and access the application at http://localhost:3000 (or the appropriate URL if configured differently).

##  Architecture

In a microservices architecture, the backend is divided into smaller services, each with a specific responsibility. In the context of a hotel booking application, you might have the following microservices:

User Service: Responsible for user registration, authentication, and user-related operations.
Hotel Service: Manages hotel-related data, such as hotel information, rooms, and availability.
Booking Service: Handles the booking and reservation processes.
Payment Service: If applicable, manages payment processing.
Notification Service: Sends notifications to users, like booking confirmations.
